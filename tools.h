 * @brief Functions to allocate memory.
 *
 * The xmalloc function is similar to malloc but prints a fatal
 * message using the tool_spf_printf function when the memory
 * allocation failed.
 *
 * The xcalloc function is similar to tool_malloc but fills
 * up all the bytes of the memory block with low value ('\0').
 *
 * The xfree macro frees the memory location pointed to
 * by the p pointer if the p pointer is not NULL. Otherwise
 * it does nothing.
